<h2 id='unit1.3.1'>1.3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  </h2>
<p>As an individual project, using Visual Studio Code and Trello was very useful to my productivity. Trello allowed me to visualise the project in terms of small tasks. I could see how much I had done and what was still to do at any given point and also give specific takss deadlines to keep myself on track. Visual studio code improved my coding efficiency as it has autocomplete functions to automatically suggest what I want to type and add end elements when I start them.</p>
<p>Collaborative tools such as Zoom and Slack could have been used in a group project, and Trello could have been used differently, assigning tasks to specific members of the group. Also, using git & github would have been useful to allow live edits to the code.</p>
<h2 id='unit1.3.2'>1.3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
<p>It can be difficult to be productive when sat, staring at a computer screen all day, therefore taking breaks is important. Frequent, but short, breaks spent away from the screen help the individual to concentrate more when they come back to their task. It is vital to stay hydrated well fed so there is no excuse to go and check the fridge when you should be working.</p>
<p>In order to improve concentration and therefore productivity during working hours, it is important to focus on what you are doing outside of working hours. A good nights sleep is necessary for alert and happy working. Also, being active when possible can help to destress and boost productivity.</p>
<h2 id='unit1.3.3'>1.3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2>
<p>Had this been a group project there would have been a second pair of eyes at every stage. It would have given an extra internal tester to spot errors and provide methods of solving problems. Also, would cut the individual work load in half, allowing the same amount of work to be done much quicker. In a team, all the members can learn different things from each others strengths within the group and if they are finding something difficult, they can ask for help or even delelgate the specific task to another member. Collaborative technologies such as Zoom and Slack could have been used to allow constant contact between group members. Also, the Trello board could have been used to it's full potential as the different tasks could have been assigned to members and given a deadline to give them accountability and motivate quick work. </p>
<h2 id='unit1.3.4'>1.3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
<p>Testing is a vital part of any project and should be done throughtout, after any section is added to the code. Personally, I test my own projects intermittently. It is important to me that I see the website developing, especially as this is such a visual project. Also, some of the more complicated details, such as adding text over images and creating navigation bars, I found difficult and didn't get right the first time. I noticed this quickly by testing and checking the code regularly.</p>
<p>Also, I sought out external testing. This code nation project has been tested and feedback given. A user perspective is very important for a website project to ensure all of the responsive aspects of the webpage are working correctly and that it is user friendly and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
