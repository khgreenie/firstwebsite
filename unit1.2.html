 <h2 id=unit1.2.1>1.2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h2>
 <p>I am very happy with my use of Visual Studio Code. As a coding newbie, I have found it very easy to use and have had no issues with it. I don't think I have used Trello to it's full potential. As I am a beginner, I didn't know all of the tasks that I would need to complete until I started and learnt more about HTML and CSS. Also, as I was working on the project alone, I didn't have any team members on the Trello board to keep me accountable.</p>
 <h2 id=unit1.2.2>1.2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello </h2>
 <p>Visual Studio Code has automatic colour coding which helps with visualising the sections and autocomplete functionality, making coding the HTML very quick. Therefore, I think it is a suitable IDE for this website project.</p><p>Trello's aesthetic and simple functionality lends itself to beginners and allows tasks to be labelled and assigned easily. This made it a good tool for this project.</p>
 <h2 id=unit1.2.3>1.2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
 <p>Due to the nature of this project as a learning device, I could definitely been more efficient with the way I created it. I found myself having to focus on the same section repeatedly as I hadn't managed to make it look how I wanted it the first time around. There are lots of links between the pages of my website and even between sections of the pages which I think are very user friendly and I am happy with, especially the hover feature, changing the colour of the text when the user hovers over it. Considering the limited time and my limited skill level, I am pleased with the funtionality of the website.</p>
 <h2 id=unit1.2.4>1.2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h2>
 <p>The main things that I want to improve about this project are the images and the About me main page. Some of the images on my website distort when the page is resized. Also, the About me main page has buttons with images on them, these are only justified to the centre of the page when the website is on fullscreen, if it is smaller the images display further towards the right.</p>
 <p>Also, to make the website more responsive and usable on a mobile device would be a big improvement for this project.</p>
 <h2 id=unit1.2.5>1.2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
 <p>I have 'Selected and used appropriate techniques to link information accross pages'. I have done this by having a navigation bar at the top of every page. Also within the 'About me' section there is a second navigation bar down the left hand side, to navigate between the pages. All of my references are linked to the external pages in a new tab. Also the links added to my Trello board, goodread and linkedin etc.</p>
