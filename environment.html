<h2>My Passion for the Environment</h2>
<div class='container_edu'>
<div>
<p>As I believe everyone should be, I am very concerned for the future of our planet. For too long, we haven't been doing <em>everything</em> we can to halt and reverse the damage that has been done. A large proportion of the problem is at corporation level, big companies not doing what they can. Therefore, I try to vote with my money and only spend at places that I think are doing their bit.</p>

<p>One of the easiest things I do is not buy into fast fashion. I don't buy clothes very often because, like a lot of people, I have too many already, when I do buy, it is mainly second hand and I do check the fabrics used, as plastic microfibers shed from synthetic fabrics when they are washed. This is also why I do not wash clothes unless they are dirty. I have also tried making and adjusting my own clothes and this is a skill that I want to improve to enable me to make exactly the clothes that I need.</p>

<p>One of the worst things I do is take flights. I love to travel to new places and see the world, it excites me so much, and there is such a variety of cultures and nature that I would love to experience. This is a difficult predicament, as obviously planes have very bad carbon emissions. This is why I aim not to fly unnessessarily this year (and next year now that coronavirus has meant that I won't be going on holiday this year anyway). Taking trains and boats are much greener and sometimes nicer ways to travel, just a lot slower, therefore long distances are a bit unfeasable. Although I did fly to Asia last October, I made it worth it by staying for 3 months and travelling mostly by boat, bus and train when I was out there. </p>

<p>As the meat and dairy industries are amongst the worst for emissions, I am a vegatarian, and I eat fresh eggs from family chickens and drink local milk, delivered in recycled bottles. There is a lot of contoversy about what are the most eco food decisions to make and I would never tell anyone what to / what not to eat. However, I try to eat the freshest, most local options, checking for seasonal, british grown vegetables and avoiding unsustainable ingrediants where I can.</p>

<h3>Useful products I use:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href='https://uk.whogivesacrap.org/' target='_blank'>Who gives a crap</a> are an amazing company that sell recycled toilet paper. The toilet paper and packaging is all made from recycled paper and is recyclable! Not only that but 50% of the profits are donated to help build toilets to help provide proper sanitation for those who need it. They also deliver in bulk and on subscription so you never run out (even during a global pandemic of stock pilers).</li>
<br>
<li>For those who menstruate, a <a href='https://www.mooncup.co.uk/' target="_blank">Moon cup</a> is an easy way to dramatically reduce waste produced every month. It is a reusable menstrual product, more convenient, cheaper in the long run and much better for the environment.</li>
<br>
<li>Very popular and rightly so are <a href='https://www.chillysbottles.com/uk' target='_blank'>Chilly's</a> water bottles. I love to have it on me at all times so I can have cold, refreshing water whenever I want and never have to buy plastic bottles of water.</li>
<br>
<li><a href='https://metalstrawco.co.uk/' target='_blank'>Metal straws</a> are the best substitute for plastic ones if you can't go without. I do often forget to carry mine with me but always ask for drinks without unnessessary plastic straws that cause so much waste.</li>

</ul>
