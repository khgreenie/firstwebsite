<h2>My Love of Animals</h2>
<p>I have always been an animal lover and growing up had a number of pet rabbit and gerbils who I adored. As a child, I constantly begged my parents to get a dog, this never happened but it is still my goal to have a dog of my own and hopefully one day I will achieve this!</p>
<br>
<p>Loving animals and nature was a big reason that I wanted to visit Borneo. Borneo is an island, partly Malaysia, partly Indonesia and the home of Brunei. In October 2019, during a longer travelling trip around South East Asia, I spent 2 weeks in Malaysian Borneo. It was a very wholesome trip, full of adventurous days and eary nights.</p>
<p>I spent a night on Selingan island, an island dedicated to the conservation of endangered green and hawsbill turtles. I learnt so much and saw a 2 metre long green turle on the beach, and many tiny, just-hatched turtles be released into the sea.</p>
<p>Borneo is known for it's population of orangutans. As well as visiting an orangutan rehabilitation centre, which was full of orphan youngsters and also, fed and aided the surrounding wild orangutans, I was lucky enough to see an adult with a child in the wild. The locals fed them jackfruit and they seemed at ease being watched, although we were told not to show our teeth or give eye contact as that can be taken as agression. This is very difficult to avoid as they seem so human and I was thrilled to see them, so just wanted to smile!</p>
<p>I also visited a rehabilitation centre for sun bears. These are bears so small that many people tried to keep them as pets, which didn't work out well for them which is why they ended up in a sanctuary. One of the bears had even been mistaken for a dog initially.</p>
<p>The activity that led to the most animal sitings was a river cruise on the Kinabatangan river. I saw:
    <ul>
        <li>Pigmy Elephants</li>
        <li>Proboscis monkeys</li>
        <li>Long-tailed macaques</li>
        <li>A crocodile</li>
        <li>Langur monkeys</li>
    </ul> </p>
<br>
<p>Recently, I mixed my love of animals with my growing maternal instinct and have helped to hatch and raise 5 ducklings and 5 peafowl chicks. One of the ducklngs was much smaller than the others so was kept in the house under a heat lamp for a few days until it grew to be strong enough to live outside with its siblings. While it was inside, it needed regular cuddles and attention, which I very much enjoyed. The ducklings have grown a lot but are yet to grow their feathers so they are still fluffy and adorable.
