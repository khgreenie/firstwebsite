<h2 id=unit2.1.1>2.1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
<p>Each of my pages has a navigation bar at the top to allow the user to manouvre through the pages. The about me page has big buttons with images on, each navgates to a separate page on a different aspect of me. Each page from the about me section has a second navigation bar which leads to the other about me pages, this nav bar has cropped versions of the pictures on the buttons from the main about me page. When hovered over, the colour of the text on the button changes.</p> 
<p>There is a page for each subunit. Each unit page has all the questions at the very top which are links that jump to the section of the page with that question. </p>
<p>There is also a contact me page and a references page. The contact me page has my contact details on it. The references throughout the website are all hyperlinked and are listed on the references page, the listed references are also hyperlinked.</p> 
<h2 id=unit2.1.2>2.1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
<p>Copyright constraints are not a problem if a websites contains entirely original content, or original and free to use stock licensed media. However, anything else requires permission, so there is no copyright infringement. </p> 
  <h2 id=unit2.1.3>2.1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
  <p>Webpages have to follow the Equality Act 2010 [<a href='http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents' target='_blank'>2</a>], this ensures that they are accessible to those with visual impairments and those with sensory sensitivity. Giving all media (images, sounds and videos) alternative descriptions and all links descriptive names, avoiding using 'click here', makes it mre likely that screen reading software will work to it's full potential. </p> 
  <h2 id=unit2.1.4>2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h2>
<p>File types that are appropriate for websites and will be compatible with all browsers include .html (webpages), .txt, .pdf, .jpg, .png (image files), .svg, .mpg (video files), and .mp3 (sound files).</p>
