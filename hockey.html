<h2>Hockey</h2>
<div id='hockey1'>
    <p class='hockeymarg'>Whislt studying at Imperial, I was an active member of the Women's 2s Hockey team. With training once a week, matches every Wednesday and Sunday and a social with the team weekly too, it was a big part of my life. I have even been back since graduating when they were short of players.</p>

<div id='hockey2'>

    <p class='hockeymarg'>Throughout my years in the team, I noticed a few inefficiencies. There were only 2 womens teams and no one was ever turned away, so this meant that the 2s became a huge team. This led to a lack of chemistry within the team and poor commitment from players as they didn't feel like they were necessary for every match. Also, there was a vast skill range within the team, therefore there was little consisitency from match to match. </p>

<div id='hockey3'>
    <p class='hockeymarg'>All of these factors led tome campaigning for the conception of a Women's 3s team for the following year. I asked my teammates opinions, put forward my reasonings and found students that would be excited to captain the team. As of October 2019, the Imperial's Women's 3s team was entered into the BUCS competition and is thriving. Even the 2s performance has been boosted. In Varisty 2020 both teams won by significant goal margins. </p>

    <p class='hockeymarg'>I still feel like a member of both teams and was thrilled to be there to watch them come out on top!</p>
