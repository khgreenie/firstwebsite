<h3>Imperial College London</h3>
<p>At Imperial College London I studied Chemistry and graduated in October 2019. It was a lot of hard work, exams and vivas, but what I enjoyed the most was the lab work. </p>
<h4>Spectrometers</h4>
<p>Over my years at Imperial I made 2 UV absorption spectrometers, these are used in analytical chemistry to determine the presence of specific molecules in a sample. One was made out of lego and the other was 3D printed. These were really fun ways of thinking about the actual engineering of the device as well as the chemistry happening within. </p>
<h4>Ooho</h4>
<p>Another fun project I did was to work with <a href='http://www.oohowater.com/'target='_blank'>Ooho water</a> to research their edible spheres. Their aim is to replace disposable plastic water bottles in some cases. We were researching whether we could put liquids that weren't water inside them. As students of course we tried vodka, this didn't work as the liquid has to be frozen and the outer layer is added to the outside of the frozen sphere, obviously vodka doesn't freeze until a very cold temperature, so an ordinary freezer is not cold enough. We also tried milk, coca cola and washing up liquid. </p>
<h4>Bending rigidity</h4>
<p>My final year project was focussed on researching the bending rigidity of vesicle membranes. This was based on deep sea organisms such as archaea, these single-cell organisms can survive under extremely high pressures. In higher pressures their membranes become more rigid, and this rigidity should stop them functioning properly. Therefore I was researching if squalane (an oil found in their membranes) reduced the bedning rigidity under high pressures, therefore allowing them to survive deep in the sea. </p>

<h3>Greenhead College</h3>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my A levels, and even picked up an extra AS level, Further Maths, in my second year at college. This meant I spent half my time in the Maths department, probably actually longer, as I was such a nerd that I would hang out there in my free periods too.
</p>
<p>This is also when I was my most musical. I had been learning to play the trumpet and the piano throughout my school life, and while I was at college, I played in 2 orchestras, a brass band and a soul band.</p>
<h3>Kettlethorpe High School</h3>
<p>I enjoyed my high school experience, did well in my GCSE's and was also a Year 11 prefect. I loved being able to study so many different subjects, so I could focus both on sciences and more creative subjects like art and textiles. </p>
