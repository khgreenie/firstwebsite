<h2>Charity work</h2>

<h3><a href='https://www.kirkleessummerplaycamp.com/' target='_blank'>Kirklees Summer Play Camp</a></h3>
<p>As a founding member of the charity and having volunteered with them since 2013, this childrens summer camp is very close to my heart. We provide 6 fun-filled, 4-day camps for yorkshire children, aged 9-11, each summer. For a lot of the children who attend, they are from disadvantaged background and this may be their summer holiday, therefore we are determined to make it the mst fun 4 days of their summers. </p>
<p>Each camp involves sleeping in tents, running games and activites, and feeding all of the children. The camps are run back-to-back and I always dedicate as much time as I can while they are running. As a volunteer, I sleep in a tent for the best part of 5 weeks, if my other commitments allow. A lot of people are shocked that anyone would choose to do this but it is so much fun and extremely fulfilling.</p>

<h3><a href='https://www.futurefrontiers.org.uk/' target="_blank">Future Frontiers</a></h3>
<p>Throughout my time at school and university, I never knew what I wanted to do for a career and I never felt like I was supported aptly enough to figure it out. While I was a student I found out about Future Frontiers, whose ethos is the stop this and guide school students in a tangible way. To give them ambition and therefore more drive to apply themselves more towards their qualifications.</p>
<p>I volunteered as a Lead Coach, meaning I was guiding a whole cohort of 20ish coaches who each lead 2 students through the course. Following 2 cohorts from the first session to the graduation was extremely uplifting and I learnt a lot myself. A few of the sessions were dedicated to matching the pupils with a professional an industry that they are potentially interested in and setting up a video call. This enabled them to understand the job roles available in that sector, what is required for them and they can ask any questions they have. I learnt a lot from these sessions and really saw how valuable it can be to give young people the opportunity to discuss their future with professionals from all industries.</p>

<h3><a href='https://www.toyboxlivecam.co.uk/' target="_blank">Toybox Nursery</a></h3>
<p>As part of my Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award, I volunteered for 4 hours a week, on a Wednesday afternoon, for a year at the Toybox Nursery in Wakefield. As a teenager I was quite inexperienced at working with toddlers but I soon found it easy to play and understand as well as doing the menial cleaning and other tasks that the workers were less keen on carrying out. I was completing my A levels at the time, so my Wednesday afternoons became a chance for me to switch off from my academics and do something completely different. </p>
<p>It was quite intimidating at times, as toddlers can be very unpredictable but I learnt to improvise with them and throughout the year my confidence grew. I was really sad to leave at the end of the year, but it was at this point that I was moving cities and going to university.</p>
