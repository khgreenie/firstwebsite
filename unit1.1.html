  <h2 id=unit1.1.1>1.1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
  <p>IT is the use of computers and telecommunications systems for storing, retrieving and sending information.
    In my limited experiences I have witnessed technology used within a hotel, to log customer information and send orders from customers to relevant staff and from the hotel to their outsourced workers. Also, working for a small water treatment consulting business, a lot of the work is done remotely, therefore IT is essential in relaying information, research and tracking.</p>
    <p>The use of IT in businesses prevents inactivity and miscommunication, promoting expansion and innovation. Storing data manually in handwritten documents is much less efficient and interactive than using digital methods. Conducting research and development can be done much quicker online, therefore promoting a boost in productivity. Business purchases, financial planning and automation are areas in which IT can assist in saving money and time whilst upholding security.</p>
  <h2 id=unit1.1.2>1.1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
  <p>Similar to traditional project management, digital projects require organisation, planning and timekeeping to keep a project progressing efficiently. Using the Kanban method on a Trello board can be used to assign and track tasks, monitoring the progression of the project and allowing everyone to edit the board with their individual progress. Digital group projects would require meetings, this could be in the form of short stand-ups to assign group members daily tasks and ensure everyone is on track. These meetings can be held in person, or remotely over platforms such as Zoom.</p>

  <h2 id=unit1.1.3>1.1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
  <p>Planning out tasks in IT could be done using the Kanban method, using the online resource Trello. Making a Trello board and using lists: To Do, Doing, Review, Done. This is a method of separating the project out into small tasks on cards on the Trello board and moving them between the lists as more and more are completed. The cards can be labelled and assigned a member if it is a group project. This ensures that everyone working on the project is held accountable and knows exactly what they and the other members of the team should be doing. Deadlines can even be added for individual tasks to keep the team on schedule.</p>
   <p>Breaking the project down into small tasks on Trello boosts productivity as the bright, visual, easy to use board inspires the want to move tasks to the ‘Done’ section. Having a review list guarantees that every task is assessed before being marked as completed and put in the done list.
    Here is a link to the Trello board used to plan and carry put this website project:

  <h2 id=unit1.1.4>1.1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
  <p>Risks that might impact digital projects could come from human error, technical issues or security breaches.</p>
    <p>
    Human Error:<br>
    These are risks of delays from group members, lack of efficiency and productivity or making errors in the code which need to be fixed, extending the time the project takes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Technical problems:<br>
    Browser problems or system updates are risks to cause delays and failure to complete the project on time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security breaches:<br>
      Security issues can be prevented using passwords, protocols and anti-virus software.
      </p>
  <h2 id=unit1.1.5>1.1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
  <p>Taking into account the time-scale, budget and size of the project should determine the IT systems and software used. For this project, it is a small scale, beginner project with the aim of learning how to deverlop a simple website. Therefore, my existing hardware and the free online/downloadable software are a suitalble choice. Trello is the free online projec management software I have used. Alongside this, Visual Studio Code is the IDE I have used for the HTML and CSS pages of the project. </p>
  <h2 id=unit1.1.6>1.1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
  <p>Trello allowed very efficient project management and allowed me to break down the whole project into smaller tasks. Visual Studio Code is useful as it has autocomplete functions and colour codes different code so it is obvious which parts of the code will be expressed as text on the website. Git and github are helpful as they can be used to manage source code history. This allows users to change parts of the code to test out something new, without deleting or breaking the current code.  </p>
  <h2 id=unit1.1.7>1.1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2>
  <p>Any digital project that retrieves any information from it's users has to follow the GDPR guidelines. These guidelines state that webistes can only collect information that they need and that users personal data is only used specifically for whath they have agreed to.
